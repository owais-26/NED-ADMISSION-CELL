          <h2>Introduction:</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            Urban engineering is a program offered by NED University that
            focuses on civil engineering for the development and design of
            residential and commercial spaces, marine construction, and public
            works. Its main objective is to manage municipal infrastructure,
            which includes planning, designing, constructing, and maintaining
            various aspects such as streets, sidewalks, water supply networks,
            sewers, street lighting, and municipal solid waste management.
            Additionally, it involves the creation and upkeep of storage depots
            for maintenance materials, public parks, and cycling infrastructure.
            The program may also cover the civil portion of local electrical and
            telecommunications service distribution networks, such as conduits
            and access chambers. Urban engineering can also optimize garbage
            collection and bus service networks.

            optimizing garbage collection and bus service networks, as well as
            the civil portion of underground utility networks. The program
            offers advanced level courses such as Urban Sociology, Engineering
            Surveying, Engineering Material, Computing Tools and Applications,
            Mechanics of Solids, Planning and Design of Transportation System,
            Geology for Engineers, Civil Work Quantity and Cost Estimation,
            Traffic Engineering and Management, Reinforced Concrete Design,
            Advance Technology and Disaster Management, and Urban Engineering
            Project. Upon graduation, urban engineering graduates can take up
            careers as historic building inspectors or conservation officers,
            housing managers or officers, local government officers, town
            planners, transport planners, urban designers, civil service
            administrators, community development workers, environmental
            managers, estates managers, landscape architects, planning and
            development surveyors, and sustainability professionals.
