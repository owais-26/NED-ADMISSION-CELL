          <h2>Introduction:</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            Electrical engineering is a vital branch of engineering that focuses
            on the technology of electricity. With a broad range of
            applications, electrical engineers design and work with components,
            devices, and systems ranging from small microchips to large power
            station generators. They use basic components such as conductors,
            coil magnets, batteries, switches, resistors, capacitors, inductors,
            diodes, and transistors to design electrical devices and systems.
            These components form the backbone of almost all electrical or
            electronic devices, from generators in power plants to
            microprocessors in phones. A deep understanding of electrical and
            electronic theory, mathematics, and materials is critical for
            electrical engineers. With this knowledge, engineers can design
            circuits to meet specific requirements for safety, reliability, and
            energy efficiency, and can predict how they will perform before a
            hardware design is implemented. For students interested in this
            field, electrical engineering offers exciting career opportunities
            in a constantly evolving industry.

          <h2>Scope & Career:</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            The scope of electrical engineering is vast, and it covers several
            areas such as power generation and distribution, control systems,
            signal processing, electronics, and telecommunications. Electrical
            engineers are involved in developing new technologies and systems to
            improve the performance, reliability, and efficiency of electrical
            systems. They may also be involved in designing and implementing
            renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, solar panels, and
            fuel cells. The growing demand for renewable energy sources is
            expected to increase the demand for electrical engineers in the
            future. The career prospects for electrical engineers are excellent,
            and the demand for qualified engineers is increasing. Electrical
            engineers can work in a wide range of industries, including power
            generation and distribution, telecommunications, manufacturing, and
            transportation. They may work in research and development, design
            and testing, or project management roles. Electrical engineers may
            also specialize in areas such as control systems,
            telecommunications, or power systems. The versatility and breadth of
            the field of electrical engineering provide a wide range of
            opportunities for graduates, making it a highly rewarding and
            fulfilling career choice.
