          <h2>Introduction:</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            The Textile Engineering program at the university began in February
            1997 after several years of planning and deliberation. The program
            is designed to meet the engineering needs of the Textile Industry by
            offering a combination of Textile Engineering and Processing
            courses. The program aims to produce qualified engineers who can
            perform maintenance/operational functions of a Textile mill and
            cover other aspects of the industry such as parts manufacture,
            machinery development, quality assurance, and environmental
            concerns. The curriculum includes courses in Mathematics, Physical
            and Social Sciences, as well as background courses in Design,
            Material Science, Strength of Materials, Thermodynamics, Fluid
            Mechanics, Electronics, Electrical Engineering, Economics, and
            Environment, to provide a basic engineering knowledge foundation.
            Textile-related courses cover Polymer and Fiber Science, Yarn and
            Fabric Manufacturing Processes, Dying and Finishing, Product
            Evaluation, and Quality Control. The program also includes guest
            lectures from industry experts and frequent visits to textile units.
            The NEDITC provides a platform for experts to address current
            challenges, latest research, trends, innovations and present
            solutions to Textile Engineering Problems. Graduates of the program
            can expect to pursue careers in areas such as parts manufacturing,
            machinery development, quality assurance, and environmental
            sustainability in the Textile Industry.

          <h2>Scope & Career: </h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            Textile Engineering offers a broad range of opportunities and career
            paths, including research and development, production, quality
            control, and marketing. Textile engineers can work in textile mills,
            garment manufacturing companies, dyeing and printing units, and many
            other related industries. With the increasing demand for sustainable
            and eco-friendly textiles, the role of textile engineers has become
            even more important in ensuring the production of high-quality,
            safe, and sustainable textiles. Furthermore, textile engineering is
            also becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, with a focus on
            integrating technology and innovation to create advanced materials
            and products for various industries.
