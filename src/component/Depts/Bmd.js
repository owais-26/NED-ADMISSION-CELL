          <p className="text-justify">
            The discipline of Biomedical Engineering deals with quantitative and
            computational methods of engineering applied to problems in medicine
            and biology. Currently it is among the most rapidly emerging fields
            of engineering around the world. The biomedical engineering involves
            application of engineering principles and techniques to medicine,
            biology, behavior and health. It combines the design and problem
            solving skills of engineering with medical, physical, chemical,
            biology and computational sciences to improve patient health care
            and the quality of life. It advances fundamental of biology and
            computational sciences to improve patient health care and the
            quality of life. It advances fundamental of concepts: generates
            knowledge from molecular to organ system level; and develops
            innovative, biologics, materials, processes, implants, devices and
            informative approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
            dieses, serves in health improvement and patient rehabilitation.
            Biomedical engineering also referred to as bioengineering BioMed or
            BME, is a multidisciplinary STEM field that combines biology and
            engineering, applying engineering principles and materials to
            medicine and healthcare. The increasing demand for Biomedical
            Engineers is linked to society's general shift towards everyday
            utilization of machinery and technology in all aspects of life.

          <p className="text-justify">
            The combination of engineering principles with biological knowledge
            to address medical needs has contributed to the development of
            revolutionary and life-saving concepts such as: Artificial organs,
            Surgical robots, Advanced prosthetics, New pharmaceutical drugs,
            Kidney dialysis. Biomedical Engineering is a broad field with
            different areas of focus, and the extract nature of the work you can
            find yourself doing will vary depending on the specifics of your
            role. A few examples of some of the subdivisions of Biomedical
            Engineering include: Biomedical Electronics, Biomaterials
            Computational Biology, Cellular/Tissue and Genetic Engineering,
            Medical Imaging, Orthopedic Bioengineering, Bionanotechnology. Also
