        <p className="text-justify">
          Applied physics serves as a link between the fundamental principles of
          physics and their practical applications in engineering and other
          scientific fields. While it is based on the fundamental concepts of
          physics, it is concerned with the use of scientific principles in the
          development of practical devices and systems, as well as the
          application of physics in other areas of science. Unlike engineering,
          applied physics focuses on conducting research with the aim of
          developing new technologies or solving engineering problems, rather
          than designing specific products. This approach is similar to that of
          applied mathematics. Applied physics also encompasses the use of
          physics for scientific research, as seen in the field of accelerator
          physics, which collaborates with engineers to design and construct
          high-energy colliders for use in theoretical physics research.

        <h2 className="DeptHead">Scope & Career:</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          A degree in applied physics is an excellent preparation for a career
          in technology, particularly in emerging areas such as energy and
          nanotechnology, and for any job that requires strong experimental,
          theoretical, or calculation skills. Applied physics offers exceptional
          training for a diverse range of positions in academia, government, and
          industry. The applied physics curriculum is highly adaptable, with
          elective courses available in various applications of the student's
          choosing. A physics degree is an excellent foundation for a career in
          scientific research, as well as a broad range of careers in fields
          such as business, finance, IT, and engineering. Potential job
          positions for applied physics graduates include acoustic consultant,
          geophysicist, healthcare scientist, medical physicist, higher
          education lecturer, metallurgist, meteorologist, nanotechnologist,
          radiation protection practitioner, research scientist (in physics or
          related fields), and secondary school teacher. Other careers where an
          applied physics degree is useful include actuary, application
          developer, data analyst, nuclear engineer, operational researcher,
          patent attorney, software engineer, and telecommunications researcher.
