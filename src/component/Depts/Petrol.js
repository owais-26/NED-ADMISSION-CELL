          <h2>Introduction:</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            Petrochemical and Polymer Engineers are responsible for transforming
            natural and synthetic materials into various products such as
            plastics, rubber, and textiles. To become a Petrochemical and
            Polymer Engineer, one can pursue a 4-year B.Tech or BE program in
            Chemical and Polymer Engineering, which is a combination of Chemical
            Engineering and Polymer Science. Students are trained in various
            computer-aided engineering software such as Accelrys and Material
            Studio for molecular simulation. Upon completion of the
            undergraduate program, one can pursue an M.Tech in Chemical and
            Polymer Engineering. The program focuses on applying engineering and
            scientific knowledge to the field of Polymer and Petrochemical
            Engineering, enabling students to optimize various processes in
            these industries. This includes material handling, fluid flow, heat
            transfer, filtration, drying, evaporation, absorption, distillation,
            and chemical and biochemical reactions in reactors.
          </p>
          <h2>Scope & Career:</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            Individuals who hold degrees in Chemical and Polymer Engineering can
            pursue a variety of career paths. Graduates can find employment
            opportunities in both private and public sector companies as
            production supervisors, quality control inspectors, mold designers,
            and production planners. They may also work as technologists or
            polymer scientists in organizations such as the Ministry of
            Petroleum and Natural Gas, Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC),
            oil laboratories, and petrochemical engineering plants. Chemical
            engineers can also choose to pursue teaching jobs and work as
            lecturers or professors in engineering institutes.
