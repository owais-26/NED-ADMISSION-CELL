          <h2>Introduction:</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            Industrial Chemistry is an exciting and dynamic field that offers a
            fascinating academic pursuit. It involves using fundamental
            principles and concepts to create various chemicals that go on to
            form the basis of a wide range of products and materials that we use
            every day. The program is designed to provide students with a
            comprehensive education in chemistry, with a focus on its importance
            in the industrial sector. Students who complete this program will
            have the knowledge and skills to perform both qualitative and
            quantitative chemical analysis, utilizing cutting-edge
            instrumentation in modern laboratories for quality control and
            process optimization. By pursuing a degree in Industrial Chemistry,
            students will gain a solid foundation in this field and be
            well-equipped to pursue a successful career in the chemical
            industry.

          <h2>About Courses:</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            Industrial Chemistry is a comprehensive four-year BS degree program
            that focuses on the principles and application of chemistry in the
            industry. The program is designed in accordance with the guidelines
            set by HEC and covers core courses of chemistry, basic sciences, and
            social sciences in the 2nd year. In the 3rd year, students take
            courses on separation techniques, natural products, industrial
            stoichiometry, nuclear chemistry, and radiation. In the 4th year,
            students have the flexibility to select four elective courses based
            on their individual interests and needs for specialization. They
            also undertake a project in their area of specialization to apply
            the knowledge and skills they have acquired throughout the program.
            The program prepares graduates to conduct qualitative and
            quantitative chemical analysis using modern instrumental techniques
            for quality and process control in the industry.
          </p>
          <h2>Scope & Career:</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            In addition to academic and research activities, Industrial
            Chemistry students also have the opportunity to gain practical
            education through industrial visits. Graduates of the program can
            pursue a variety of career paths, including roles as laboratory
            analysts, product managers, development chemists, and production
            chemists. The program prepares students with the necessary knowledge
            and skills to excel in these fields and make a meaningful
            contribution to the industry.
