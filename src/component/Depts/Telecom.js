          <h2>Introduction:</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            The undergraduate program in telecommunications engineering offered
            by the university is recognized by the Pakistan Engineering Council
            (PEC). Telecom engineering is a field of electrical and computer
            engineering that is focused on supporting and advancing
            communication systems. Students in this program will learn how to
            design and oversee the installation of telecommunications equipment
            and facilities such as electronic switching systems, telephone
            facilities, fiber optic cabling, IP data systems, and radio link
            systems. Additionally, the program also covers topics that overlap
            with broadcast engineering. With the increasing need for faster
            communication and data transfer, the demand for telecommunication
            engineers is continuously growing. The main objective of this
            program is to equip students with the skills to understand the
            workings of communication systems including satellites, telescopes,
            and radars both within and beyond the field. The courses are
            designed to cover topics such as networking, electronics, and
            satellite communication.
