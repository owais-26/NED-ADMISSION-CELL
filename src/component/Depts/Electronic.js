          <h2>Introduction:</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            Electronic engineering is an exciting field that focuses on the
            study and practical application of electronic circuits, devices, and
            systems. It encompasses the design, development, testing,
            production, and maintenance of electronic systems and devices. As
            technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, electronic
            engineering plays a critical role in the development of new
            technologies. The Bachelor's program in Electronics Engineering (EL)
            at NEDUET is a four-year program that follows the Outcome Based
            Education (OBE) system. This program aims to provide students with a
            comprehensive understanding of Electronics Devices and Electrical
            Systems, preparing them for rewarding careers in this constantly
            evolving field. With its emphasis on practical, hands-on learning,
            the program equips students with the skills and knowledge needed to
            excel in the electronics industry.
